# The Pocketbox Manifesto

## Why Pocketbox Exists

Pocketbox exists because learning should not be blocked by infrastructure.

Too often, students, hackers, and curious builders are told:
- “Install Docker first”
- “You need a VM”
- “This won’t work on your device”
- “Your system isn’t supported”

Pocketbox was created to remove those barriers.

## What Pocketbox Believes

### 1. Learning Should Be Lightweight
You should be able to run a lab without a daemon, a hypervisor, or a complex setup.

If you want to learn how systems break — you shouldn’t first have to fight your system.

---

### 2. Transparency Beats Abstraction
Pocketbox does not hide how things work.

Processes are real.  
Ports are real.  
Files are real.  
Networking is real.

This makes Pocketbox ideal for understanding **how systems actually behave**, not just how tools simulate them.

---

### 3. Education Comes Before Isolation
Pocketbox is not designed for production security or strong sandboxing.

It is designed for:
- Learning
- Experimentation
- Controlled labs
- Understanding cause and effect

Strong isolation can be added later. Understanding cannot be skipped.

---

### 4. Tools Should Work Where People Are
Not everyone has:
- Root access
- A powerful laptop
- A supported OS

Pocketbox works where people already are:
- On Linux
- On low‑resource machines
- On Termux
- On mobile devices

If Docker cannot run there, Pocketbox should.

---

### 5. Security Is Learned by Breaking and Fixing
You cannot learn security only by reading.

Pocketbox embraces:
- Vulnerable services
- Misconfigurations
- Unsafe code (in labs)
- Real attack surfaces

Only by breaking systems can we learn how to defend them.

---

## What Pocketbox Is

- A lightweight container‑like runtime
- A lab platform
- A learning tool
- A bridge between theory and reality

---

## What Pocketbox Is Not

- Not a Docker replacement
- Not a production container runtime
- Not an enterprise platform
- Not designed for untrusted workloads

Pocketbox is intentionally opinionated.

---

## The Long‑Term Vision

Pocketbox aims to become:
- The easiest way to run security labs
- A standard tool in learning environments
- A platform for CTFs and practice ranges
- A foundation for teaching systems, networking, and security

Not by being bigger — but by being clearer.

---

## A Promise

Pocketbox promises to:
- Stay simple
- Stay transparent
- Stay honest about its limits
- Serve learners first
- Avoid unnecessary complexity

When a tool becomes harder to learn than the topic itself, it has failed.

Pocketbox exists to make learning easier.

**Pocketbox — containers for learning, labs, and curiosity.**
